                    <p>We didn’t learn about whisky in boardrooms or lecture halls — we learned it behind the
                        bar,
                        in conversations that stretched long into the night. We poured drams for everyone from
                        curious first-timers to seasoned collectors, learning from every exchange.</p>
                    <p>With years of experience at one of the world’s finest whisky bars, we’ve had the
                        privilege of
                        serving thousands of expressions, hearing countless distillery stories, and discovering
                        what
                        people truly want when they reach for a bottle.</p>
                    <p>But here’s what we noticed: the best whisky moments rarely happened in our bar.</p>
                    <p>They happened on hilltops. Around campfires. In bothies where exhausted hikers became
                        instant
                        friends over a shared dram. The whiskies that mattered most weren’t the rarest or most
                        expensive — they were the ones that were there when it counted: light enough to carry,
                        robust enough to survive the journey, and exceptional enough to make the moment
                        unforgettable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bothy Blend</strong> is everything we’ve learned, distilled down.</p>
                    <p>No pretension. No fragile glass bottles to weigh you down. No need to handle with care.
                        Just
                        outstanding Scottish whisky from distilleries we know and trust — crafted for the way
                        whisky
                        should be enjoyed: outdoors, with friends, in places that take effort to reach.</p>
                    <p>We’ve spent years perfecting the art of whisky service. Now we’re bringing that expertise
                        to
                        the people who need it most — the adventurers, the hillwalkers, the bothy-dwellers who
                        know
                        that the best dram isn’t defined by a price tag, but by the company you share it with
                        and
                        the view before you when you take that first sip.</p>
